# Kronologic Mystery Game - Scenario Generator

**[View on GitHub Pages](https://cschubiner.github.io/kronologic/)**

A deduction game where players ask questions about character movements through rooms over time to solve mysteries. This tool generates valid scenarios with configurable difficulty using SAT solving.

- **[Digital Note Sheet](digital-note-sheet.html)** - Interactive note-taking tool for tracking deductions during gameplay

## How the Game Works

### Core Mechanics

Players investigate what happened during a night at a mansion (or other location) by asking two types of questions:

#### 1. Location + Time Questions
**"How many different characters were in [Location] at [Time X]?"**

- **Shared Information (üü¢)**: Everyone hears the COUNT of characters
- **Private Information (‚ö™)**: Only the asker sees ONE randomly selected character who was there

Example: "How many characters were in the Gallery at t=3?"
- Shared: "4 characters were in Gallery at t=3"
- Private: "One character present: Detective"

#### 2. Location + Character Questions
**"How many times did [Character] visit [Location] across all timesteps?"**

- **Shared Information (üü¢)**: Everyone hears the total VISIT COUNT
- **Private Information (‚ö™)**: Only the asker sees ONE randomly selected time when they visited

Example: "How many times did Servant visit the Foyer?"
- Shared: "3 visits by Servant to Foyer"
- Private: "One time visited: t=2"

### Winning the Game

Players must deduce the secret scenario by combining:
- Public information (counts) that everyone knows
- Private information only they've seen
- Logical deduction about what's possible given the constraints

## Scenarios

**Note**: You can only select ONE scenario per puzzle generation. Each scenario creates a unique mystery to solve.

### S1: Poison (Assassin)
**Mystery**: One character poisoned someone at a specific time and location.

**Rules**:
- The assassin is always the **first character** in your character list (by default "A")
- Exactly one victim (not the assassin) was poisoned
- At exactly one (time, room) pair (the "poison moment"):
  - The assassin and victim are both present
  - NO other characters are present (exactly 2 people total)
- At ALL other (time, room) pairs where the assassin is present:
  - Either the assassin is completely alone (1 person), OR
  - At least 2 other people are present with the assassin (3+ people total)
  - The assassin is NEVER alone with exactly one other person except at the poison moment
- You can optionally fix the poison room and/or poison time

**Goal**: Identify the victim, poison time, and poison room.

**Difficulty Factors**: Other character pairs being alone together at various times creates red herrings that look like potential poison moments.

### S2: Phantom
**Mystery**: One character was mysteriously alone at every single timestep.

**Rules**:
- Exactly one character is the phantom
- At EVERY timestep (t=1, t=2, ..., t=T):
  - The phantom is in some room
  - NO other character is in the same room as the phantom
  - The phantom is completely isolated at that timestep
- All non-phantom characters must share a room with at least one other character at some point during the timeline
  - This prevents non-phantoms from being completely isolated throughout all timesteps

**Goal**: Identify which character is the phantom.

**Difficulty Factors**: Characters who are alone frequently (but not at every timestep) are harder to distinguish from the true phantom. The more timesteps a non-phantom spends alone, the harder the puzzle.

---

### S3: The Singer's Jewels
**Mystery**: A priceless necklace keeps changing hands. The first thief is the first person alone with it in the first listed room (the ‚ÄúDance Hall‚Äù), and any time the holder meets exactly one other person, the jewels pass.

**Rules**:
- At least one character must visit the first room defined in the map during the timeline
- Beyond the guaranteed visit, schedules remain unconstrained; the passing narrative is left for downstream clue logic

**Goal**: Track who entered the key room and build the story of how the jewels moved.

**Difficulty Factors**: With more characters and longer timelines, multiple suspects may plausibly be first to reach the room, complicating deduction.

---

### S4: Bomb Duo
**Mystery**: Two accomplices are planning something suspicious.

**Rules**:
- Exactly two characters are the bombers (A1 and A2)
- The bombers are distinct (A1 ‚â† A2)
- They must be alone together (exactly those two, no one else) in at least one room/time during the schedule
- **Critical constraint**: For ANY (time, room) pair, if exactly 2 characters are present in that room at that time, those 2 characters MUST be the bombers
- Equivalently: The bombers are the ONLY pair who can ever be alone together
- Other character groupings are allowed:
  - 1 person (anyone can be alone, including bombers)
  - 3+ people (any combination, including with or without bombers)
- But exactly 2 people in a room is ONLY allowed if those 2 are the bombers

**Goal**: Identify the two bombers.

**Difficulty Factors**: The constraint is very restrictive. Bombers being in larger groups (camouflage) and groups of exactly 3 people (near-misses) increase difficulty.

---

### S5: Lovers
**Mystery**: Two characters are secret lovers who never meet.

**Rules**:
- Exactly two characters are the lovers (L1 and L2)
- The lovers are distinct (L1 ‚â† L2)
- The lovers NEVER share a room at any timestep:
  - For ALL (time, room) pairs: L1 and L2 are never both present
- **Every pair of non-lovers must meet at least once**:
  - For any two characters who are NOT both lovers, they must share a room at some (time, room) pair
  - This ensures all non-lovers encounter each other at least once
  - The lovers themselves never meet each other

**Goal**: Identify the two lovers.

**Difficulty Factors**: Other character pairs who rarely meet (but do meet at least once) create confusion about who the actual lovers are. Pairs that meet exactly once are strong red herrings.

---

### S6: Phantom + Lovers
**Mystery**: One character is a phantom (alone at every timestep) AND there are two lovers who never meet.

**Rules**:
- Combines S2 (Phantom) and S5 (Lovers) constraints
- Exactly one character is the phantom:
  - At EVERY timestep, the phantom is alone in their room
  - NO other character shares a room with the phantom at any time
  - The phantom is in their own category - neither a lover nor a non-lover
- Exactly two characters are the lovers (L1 and L2):
  - The lovers NEVER share a room at any timestep
  - The lovers are distinct from the phantom
  - **Neither lover can be the phantom** (phantom is always alone, so can't have a relationship)
- **Every pair of non-phantom, non-lovers must meet at least once**:
  - For any two characters who are NOT lovers AND NOT the phantom, they must share a room at some point
  - This ensures all "regular" characters encounter each other
  - The phantom is excluded from this requirement (they never meet anyone)

**Goal**: Identify the phantom and the two lovers.

**Difficulty Factors**: The phantom is easy to identify (always alone). The two lovers must avoid each other while still meeting all other non-phantom characters. Other pairs who rarely meet create confusion about who the lovers are.

---

### S7: Aggrosassin
**Mystery**: One character is a serial poisoner who kills everyone they meet one-on-one.

**Rules**:
1. **Exactly one aggrosassin** exists (can be any character, not necessarily the first)

2. **Minimum kill frequency**: The aggrosassin must be in a 1-on-1 meeting (exactly 2 people in a room) for at least **‚åäT/2‚åã timesteps** (minimum of 2)
   - Example: With T=6, the aggrosassin must have 1-on-1 meetings in at least 3 different timesteps; with T=5, they need at least 2
   - This ensures the aggrosassin is actively hunting throughout the timeline

3. **Meeting dominance**: The aggrosassin has at least **twice as many** kill meetings as any other character experiences
   - Count only the times where someone is alone with the aggrosassin (these are the confirmed kills)
   - Innocent characters can have solo meetings with each other, but those don't affect the kill tally comparison
   - This numerical tell replaces the old "every pair must include the aggrosassin" rule
   - Practically, this scenario requires at least **three characters** so the aggrosassin can outpace everyone else

4. **Victims**: The aggrosassin kills everyone they meet 1-on-1
   - Victims = all characters who were alone with the aggrosassin at any timestep
   - A character can be alone with the aggrosassin multiple times (still counts as one victim)

5. **Flexibility otherwise**: The aggrosassin can spend other timesteps alone, in pairs with victims, or in larger groups (which help disguise them between kills)
   - Repeated meetings with the same victim are allowed, but they must still maintain the 2√ó meeting lead

**Goal**: Identify the aggrosassin and determine how many victims they claimed.

**Difficulty Factors**:
- More victims = harder to identify the pattern (more characters to track)
- Non-aggrosassin 1-on-1 meetings become red herrings, since some innocent pairs now meet alone
- The aggrosassin is not marked (unlike S1 where it's always the first character), so players must deduce who it is from the pattern
- The "half of timesteps" constraint ensures consistent killing behavior, making the pattern more detectable

**Scoring**: Difficulty = (number of victims √ó 10) + (total 2-person meetings in entire scenario)
- More victims increases difficulty significantly (heavily weighted)
- More kill moments (each 2-person meeting) also raises the score

---

### S8: The Freeze
**Mystery**: Mr. Freeze is on the loose. Anyone they catch alone is frozen in place for the rest of the timeline.

**Rules**:
- Exactly one character is the Freeze
- Whenever the Freeze shares a room with exactly **one** other person, that person is frozen
- Frozen characters remain in that room for all remaining timesteps (even if `mustMove=true`)
- The Freeze must freeze at least one victim before the final timestep (players need a visible clue)
- Frozen victims can be visited later, but they never move again

**Goal**: Identify Mr. Freeze and list every frozen victim (with their freeze moments).

**Difficulty Factors**:
- More frozen victims make the answer clearer (easier mystery)
- 1-on-1 meetings between non-Freeze characters act as red herrings and increase difficulty
- Late freeze events give fewer turns to notice immobilised victims, raising difficulty

**Scoring**: Difficulty starts at 40, decreases by 10 for each frozen victim, and increases by 5 for every 1-on-1 meeting that does **not** include the Freeze.

## Using the Generator

### Basic Setup

1. **Define the Map**: Use Mermaid-like syntax to create room connections
   ```
   graph TD
     Foyer --- Stairs
     Foyer --- Gallery
     Gallery --- Masks
   ```

2. **Set Characters**: Comma-separated list (e.g., "A, B, C, D, S, J")

3. **Choose Timesteps**: How many time periods (2-10, typically 6)

4. **Movement Rules**:
   - "Must move each time": Characters can't stay in the same room
   - "Allow stay": Characters can remain in their current room

### Scenario Selection

Enable one or more scenarios:
- **S1 (Poison)**: Optional fixed room/time
- **S2 (Phantom)**: No configuration needed
- **S3 (Singer's Jewels)**: No configuration needed
- **S4 (Bomb)**: No configuration needed (bombers automatically share a private 1-on-1 moment)
- **S5 (Lovers)**: No configuration needed
- **S6 (Phantom + Lovers)**: No configuration needed
- **S7 (Aggrosassin)**: No configuration needed
- **S8 (The Freeze)**: No configuration needed

### Difficulty Control

**Percentile (0-100)**: Controls puzzle difficulty
- **0-20**: Easiest puzzles (few red herrings)
- **40-60**: Medium difficulty
- **80-100**: Hardest puzzles (many confusing patterns)

**Samples**: How many scenarios to generate (10-5000)
- More samples = better percentile accuracy
- Recommended: 100-500 for good results

### How Difficulty Scoring Works

The generator creates many valid scenarios and scores them based on "red herrings" - patterns that look suspicious but aren't the actual solution. Higher scores = harder puzzles.

#### S1: Poison Scoring
**What makes it harder**: Other character pairs being alone together at various times

- **+60 points** for each pair of characters (not assassin-victim) who are alone together at any time/room
- The more "suspicious pairs" exist, the harder it is to identify the actual poisoning

**Example**: If characters B and C are alone in the Library at t=2, and D and E are alone in the Kitchen at t=4, that's +120 difficulty (2 red herring pairs).

#### S2: Phantom Scoring
**What makes it harder**: Characters who are alone frequently (but not always)

- **+100 points** per character who is alone T-1 or T-2 times (weighted by proportion)
- **+50 points** per character who is alone ‚â•50% of the time (weighted by proportion)
- Characters who are "almost phantoms" make it much harder to identify the true phantom

**Example**: With T=6 timesteps, if character B is alone 5 times (but not all 6), that's a strong red herring worth ~83 points.

#### S4: Bomb Duo Scoring
**What makes it harder**: Bombers being camouflaged in larger groups, and "near miss" groups of 3

- **+40 points** each time the bombers are together in a room WITH other people (not alone)
  - This camouflages them since they're not obviously the "only pair"
- **+30 points** for each group of exactly 3 people at any time/room
  - Groups of 3 are "near misses" - one person away from being a suspicious pair
  - Creates confusion about what counts as a "pair"

**Example**: If bombers meet in the Library with 2 other people at t=2 and t=4, that's +80. If there are 4 groups of 3 people throughout the timeline, that's +120 more, for +200 total difficulty.

#### S5: Lovers Scoring
**What makes it harder**: Character pairs who rarely meet

- **+100 points** for pairs who never meet (0 meetings)
- **+80 points** for pairs who meet exactly once
- **+40 points** for pairs who meet 2 times
- Pairs that avoid each other create confusion about who the actual lovers are

**Example**: With T=6, if characters A and B never meet, C and D meet once, and E and F meet twice, that's +220 difficulty from red herrings.

#### S7: Aggrosassin Scoring
**What makes it harder**: More victims and more pair meetings in general

- **+10 points per victim** (character who was alone with aggrosassin)
  - More victims = more characters to track and more complex patterns
  - Heavily weighted to emphasize kill count as primary difficulty factor
- **+1 point per instance** of exactly 2 people in a room (any pair, including aggrosassin)
  - Creates noise in the data - harder to identify which pairs are significant
  - Every "alone together" moment adds to the confusion

**Example**: If the aggrosassin kills 3 victims (30 points) and there are 12 total instances of pairs being alone throughout the timeline (12 points), that's 42 difficulty total.

#### Combined Scoring
When multiple scenarios are enabled, scores are added together. The percentile selection then picks from the sorted list:
- **0th percentile**: Minimum score (easiest)
- **50th percentile**: Median score
- **100th percentile**: Maximum score (hardest)

Higher percentiles select scenarios with more confusing patterns.

## Technical Details

- **SAT Solver**: Uses DPLL algorithm with unit propagation
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds per scenario attempt (skips if too complex)
- **Deterministic**: Same seed produces same scenario
- **Pure JavaScript**: Runs entirely in browser, no server needed

## Development

### Local Development Server

The scenario generator uses ES6 modules, which require a web server (they don't work with `file://` protocol due to CORS restrictions). To run locally:

```bash
# Start the development server
bun run dev
```

Then open your browser to:
- **Scenario Generator**: http://localhost:3000/scenario_handler_gpt.html
- **Note Sheet**: http://localhost:3000/digital-note-sheet.html

**Note**: The generator works perfectly on GitHub Pages without any build step. The dev server is only needed for local development.

### Running Tests

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) for running tests:

```bash
bun test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
bun test --watch
```

## Note-Taking Interface

The **note-sheet.html** file provides an interactive note-taking tool designed for players to track their deductions during gameplay.

### Features

**Time-Step Mini-Maps**
- Visual representation of the location graph for each timestep
- Click any room to add/remove character placements
- Color-coded character chips show who you believe was where
- Strikethrough mode (click chip) marks "NOT here" deductions
- Adaptive grid layout (responsive for mobile/tablet/desktop)

**Character Placement Tracking**
- Add character initials to rooms by clicking
- Toggle strikethrough to mark negative deductions (e.g., "Detective was NOT in Office at t=3")
- Remove placements with √ó button
- Visual feedback: room borders change color when characters are placed

**Visit Count Table**
- Track how many times each character visited each location
- Input boxes for recording shared information from questions
- Helps identify patterns and contradictions

**Deduction Notes**
- Rich text editor with formatting (bold, italic, lists)
- Record logical chains and elimination reasoning
- Auto-saves to browser localStorage

**Undo/Redo System**
- Full history tracking (up to 50 states)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+Y (redo)
- Recover from mistakes easily

**Data Persistence**
- Auto-saves all placements, counts, and notes to localStorage
- Export to JSON file for backup or sharing
- Survives page refresh

### Intended Workflow

1. **Generate a scenario** using the main generator (scenario_handler_gpt.html)
2. **Open note-sheet.html** in a separate tab/window
3. **As you ask questions**, record information:
   - Shared counts go in the visit tracking table
   - Private character sightings get placed on the time-step maps
   - Logical deductions go in the notes area
4. **Use visual patterns** to spot contradictions:
   - If a character appears in two places at once, you made an error
   - Strikethrough helps track "impossible" placements
   - Color-coding makes it easy to see character movements
5. **Solve the mystery** by combining all information sources

### Integration with Main Generator

The note sheet is designed to work alongside the scenario generator:
- Generator provides the **questions and answers**
- Note sheet provides the **workspace for deduction**
- Players manually transfer information between the two tools
- This separation keeps private information truly private (each player has their own note sheet)

### Example Use Case

**Scenario**: S2 (Phantom) with 6 characters, 6 timesteps

1. Player asks: "How many characters in Gallery at t=3?" ‚Üí Answer: "2 characters"
2. Player records "2" in their notes
3. Player's private info: "One character present: Detective"
4. Player clicks Gallery on t=3 mini-map, adds Detective chip
5. Later, player learns Detective was also in Foyer at t=3 (contradiction!)
6. Player uses strikethrough on Gallery placement to mark it as wrong
7. Player writes in notes: "Detective NOT in Gallery at t=3 - must be in Foyer"

## Example Workflow

1. Generate 100 scenarios at 75th percentile with S2 (Phantom) enabled
2. System creates 100 valid solutions, scores them by difficulty
3. Selects a scenario from the 60-80th percentile range
4. Players ask questions using the Question Interface
5. Players use the note-taking interface to track deductions
6. Players deduce which character is the phantom based on:
   - How many people were in each room at each time (shared)
   - Specific character sightings (private to each player)
   - Logical elimination using their notes

## Tips for Game Masters

- Start with **50th percentile** for new players
- Use **S2 (Phantom)** or **S5 (Lovers)** for simpler mysteries
- **S4 (Bomb)** is very restrictive and creates unique patterns
- Combine multiple scenarios for expert-level challenges
- More timesteps = more data = easier deduction
- Fewer characters = easier to track
